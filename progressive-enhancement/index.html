        <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
        <p>Progressive Enhancement is a way of web development that was created to make the web more universal. Progressive Enhancement is based around the content of websites. The core being the content, next the CSS and finally to top everything off the java script.</p>
        <p>Progessive Enhancement is putting together all of the coding elements(HTML, CSS and Java Script) in order to create a website. It makes sure that everyone can get what they need so for the people that can't see the Css and Java Script they still have the content. It breaks all of the parts up so everyone can take away some or all of it.</p>
